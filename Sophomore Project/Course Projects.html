            <p>I had co-developed a movie recommendation program to create a tool that
            helps users discover films aligned with their interests. This program connected
            to a public movie database, providing access to a wide selection of titles.
            The program featured advanced filtering options, allowing users to search by
            actors or genres. This program included memory functionality for users to save movies
            they have watched.</p>

            <p>I had created an developed a SQL server on a home network, populating it with sensitive
            customer data. This included addresses, phone numbers, and social security numbers. I had
            verified data integrity with thorough checks and developed security protocols to restrict
            access to authorized users only.</p>
