                        I often code in my free time to sharpen my skills. I often look for new
                        functions and new optimizations to implement into my code.

            <p>
                I repair broken tech that I find online with a friend. Together, we try to
                diagnose the problems, fix the issues (whether that is physical or digital),
                and sell it or keep it ourselves.

            <p>
                Recently, I have began learning how to 3D model. These 3D models
                I plan on eventually implementing into a video game. I am still relatively new to learning
                this skill, but I am eager to continue to improve.
